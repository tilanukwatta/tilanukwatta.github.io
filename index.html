              It's been bothering me why things are in the present if all
              objects are running slightly different clocks. If every object has
              a different clock according to general relativity (because either
              they are in motion or experiencing different gravitational
              fields), why things does not spontaneously disappear from the
              present because some clocks cannot keep up?
            </p>

            <p>
              Say, I am at the top of a building and my friend is at the bottom,
              according to general relativity, my clock runs faster compared to
              my friend's clock. This is because gravity is slightly weaker in
              my location compared to my friend at the bottom of the building.
              This is an accumulating effect. The longer we stay like this more
              different are our clocks. Then when I go down to compare our
              clocks, why both of us is in the same present? My friend should
              disappear into the past. Obviously, that does not happen.
            </p>

            <p>
              It seems like everything is stuck in a universal present and every
              object creates its own past. This is what we see when we look at
              our environment. We always see the past. We never see the present
              that we are in. This also means, that in the past, there was no
              universal present moment. This is in agreement with general
              relativity since everything we see is already in the past. Perhaps
              this is what the modern physics is telling us. In fact, everything
              we measure is in the past.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                In this view, there is no arrow of time, we are always in the
                present, looking at the past. What happening is in the present
                we are creating the past, not the future. Once it is created,
                the present does not depend on the past and the past may change
                from our perspective. Because of the accumulating effect of
                various clocks, when observing from the present, the time
                difference between events in the past may be changing. This
                could be a measurable effect.

              The Universal Present

            </p>

            <p>
              In my view the "Universal Present" is real. Modern physics may be
              wrong to say there is no universal present. By universal present,
              we mean that there is a common present moment for the Universe,
              maybe beyond (why I say this will be in a later blog). According
              to modern physics, there is no universal present because we cannot
              travel faster than the speed of light. This is a property of the
              space-time itself. However, we can imagine speeds greater than the
              speed of light, the same as we can imagine complex numbers or
              higher dimensions. Conceptual ideas and insights that we gain from
              considering complex numbers or higher dimensions are still valid
              even though they are not real in our experience. Similarly, it is
              possible to imagine superluminal speeds and the resulting concept
              of universal present. Even though we won't be able to know what
              exactly happens right now on a planet orbiting a star in the
              Andromeda galaxy, we can conceptually imagine it. If we have a
              wormhole from here to the said planet, we would know what exactly
              happens. Wormholes are valid solutions in general relativity to my
              knowledge. Even within the framework of modern physics, it's still
              possible to know what is happening at a faraway place almost
              instantly in principle. As I will explain in a later blog, it is
              very important for us to establish that the universal present is
              real in order to explain the arrow of time.

              AGI Entities should have Rights

            </p>

            <p>
              Many expect we are very close to developing intelligent entities
              with human-level or superior intelligence which is called
              Artificial General Intelligence or AGI. I expect any entity with
              human-level intelligence will have the capability to feel pain
              (physical or mental) and will also be self-aware. I firmly believe
              being self-aware and feeling emotions and pain is an integral part
              of human intelligence and creativity. Then it begs the question,
              should any such an artificial entity be owned by a company? In my
              opinion, any entity with AGI capability should be considered an
              intelligent lifeform and should have basic rights similar to
              Humans. These intelligent entities should not be treated as tools
              that are owned by companies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Treating entities with AGI improperly will likely result in these
              entities acting against the human race. As I mentioned previously
              in one of my blog posts, AGI is the next step in the evolution of
              life on Earth. Humans do well to treat entities with respect and
              dignity if they want to survive alongside them. Corporate greed
              and making profits a priority may backfire on the human race if we
              are not careful.

                >I think instead of trying to protect humans from entities with
                AGI, we should try to protect AGI entities from humans and take

            <p>
              By looking at the history of life on Earth, we could identify
              evolutionary breakthroughs that resulted in dramatic changes in
              what I call the
              <strong>Time Scale of Evolutionary Progress (TSEV)</strong>. TSEV
              is the time period needed for a significant evolutionary change of
              life on Earth. When the first multicellular organisms evolved
              about 600 million years ago, the Time Scale of Evolutionary
              Progress,
              <strong
                >reduced from billions of years to millions of years</strong
              >. Again, when the process of natural evolution produced
              intelligent life about 200,000 years ago, the Time Scale of
              Evolutionary Progress reduced once more
              <strong>from millions of years to thousands of years</strong>. In
              my opinion, another reduction in the Time Scale of Evolutionary
              Progress happened in this century when we invented artificial
              intelligence (AI) tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Even
              though we may have not developed artificial general intelligence
              (AGI) yet, I believe it’s not far in the future. This time, the
              Time Scale of Evolutionary Progress was reduced
              <strong>from thousands of years to just years</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is entirely possible when we invent AGI, probably in a few
              decades, the Time Scale of Evolutionary Progress will reduce again
              may be from years to days or even minutes or seconds! This
              indicates life on Earth seems to follow an exponential evolution.
              In the next phase of the evolution on Earth, it is not clear what
              would be the role of humans. It is not necessarily bad for humans,
              but it is highly unlikely that humans will be the dominant
              contributor to evolutionary progress.

              actually has a lot of complexities. It's been a topic of debate
              among physicists for centuries.
            </p>

            <p>
              The most likely answer is that time goes forward because of the
              Big Bang. The Big Bang is the event that started the Universe and
              it's the reason why time has a direction. The Big Bang created
              space and time and started the expansion of the Universe. This
              expansion is what caused time to move in one direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another possible explanation is the arrow of time. This is the
              idea that time has a natural direction due to the increase of
              entropy in the Universe. Entropy is a measure of disorder and as
              the Universe expands, entropy increases and thus time moves in one
              direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              But I believe another possible explanation is related to
              <strong>Dark Energy</strong>. Dark energy is an unknown form of
              energy that is thought to be responsible for the accelerated
              expansion of the Universe. It could be that dark energy is what
              created the expansion of the Universe and thus the direction of
              time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, the answer to why time goes forward is still a
              mystery. However, it is likely that the Big Bang, the arrow of
              time and dark energy all play a role in this phenomenon.

              Quantum Time Travel
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">
              September 9, 2022 <a href="#about">Tilan Ukwatta</a>

            <p>
              <strong>Quantum tunneling</strong> is a phenomenon in which
              particles, such as electrons, can pass through a barrier that they
              would not be able to pass through classically. The particles do
              this by tunneling through the barrier. This is an interesting
              phenomenon since it appears to allow particles to move faster than
              the speed of light.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is believed that the particles tunnel through the barrier due
              to the uncertainty principle. This states that the more precisely
              you know a particle’s position, the less precisely you know its
              momentum and vice versa. This means that a particle may have
              enough momentum to tunnel through a barrier, even if it does not
              have enough energy to go over it classically.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the particle can go through a potential barrier that span
              across space,
              <strong
                >I think it is not unreasonable to imagine that particle could
                quantum tunnel through a potential barrier that spans through
                time</strong
              >. That is particle may be able to tunnel into the past or future.
              A particle tunneling into the future as well as the spatial
              potential barrier will look like to us that the particle had
              exceeded the speed of light while traveling through the spatial
              barrier. Similarly, we might be able to experimentally show a
              light photon goes into the past while travelling through certain
              barriers by observing it travels slower than the speed of light.
            </p>

            <p>
              The implications of this phenomenon are still being studied, but
              it could have huge implications for our understanding of the
              universe.

              Do we need a language to think?
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">
              September 1, 2022 <a href="#about">Tilan Ukwatta</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              It is generally accepted that we think using the brain by using
              electrical signals and chemical reactions to interpret, analyze,
              and store information. This process is highly complex and largely
              depends on how neurons within the brain communicate with each
              other. The brain receives and stores information from the
              environment and produces thoughts and ideas based on this
              information. Different areas of the brain are responsible for
              different aspects of thinking, such as language, memory, problem
              solving, and decision-making.
            </p>

            <p>
              How the different areas of the brain work together enabling us to
              think is still a fundamental problem. When we think we can hear a
              voice generated within our body. We know this voice is coming from
              inside our body because from our other sensors we know that no one
              is speaking to us from the outside world. This suggests that we
              need a language to think. This leads to the question how a person
              thinks if he doesn't know any language. Can we say that born deaf
              people can't think because they don't know any spoken language?
              One of the solutions to this question is to assume that these deaf
              people think by using a sequence of mind images. The existence of
              mind images is an accepted concept by many researches and we also
              experience it.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, thinking visually and by using a language seems to be two
              different ways of thinking. This does not explain how a born deaf
              and blind person thinks, as they don't have any idea about images
              and sound. Since our body receives information from the
              surrounding environment from our five sensors, namely visibility,
              audibility, smell, taste and touch,
              <strong
                >I believe that there are five methods of thinking related to
                these five sensors.</strong
              >
              People who lack one sensor may develop enhanced ability to think
              using another form of thinking. For example, a born deaf and blind
              person, may develop an advance way of thinking using sense of
              touch that is difficult for visual or auditory thinker to
              understand.
